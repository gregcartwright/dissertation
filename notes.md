# Lecture notes

ethics proposal appendices should contain stuff like particip[ant infoermation sheet, consent form.

## The literature review

It should show how the cummulative knowledge in the field funnels down to focus on your subject.
It should justify why you researched what you did. It should be thorough.
It is useful to recognise yourself as an insider to the field, and how this can sway your judgemnent.

It should lead into your ontology. End the literature reiew chapter with a summary.
Inculsion and exclusion criteria can be listed in an appendix to save words.
Need to justify inclusion and exclusion criteria.

+ Read Louises paper on how to write literature review.

## The ethics proposal

Watch the presentation that is linked on the VLE - how to write an ethics proposal.

The application framework is included in the module guide as an appendix. There is a MSword version on 
VLE too.

It is acceptable, or even expected, for your result to not expect to be generalisable. It would be
useful to comeplete the online HRA tool and include a copy of the result in an appendix to the proposal.
Can include evidence from R&D dept in appendix too.

Louise advises to avoid CAG - ?? do I need it?

Make the desription of the setting as genera las possible to avoid identifying the Trust. Try googling
your description and see if the Trust can be identified.

Chair of the HSC School ethics committe is Karen Sanders.

The proposal must be one document containing *everything*.

Need to think what to do if I inadvertently discover poor pratice.

You may need permission from the Chief Nurse - include as an appendix.

Question: Does accessing patient notes for this study require patient's to consent?

# Lecture 18 Oct 2017

Use the appropriate language for quantitative research.
EG "how I will use my results..."
Need to check the validity of your tools - eg CFS in my context.

## Power calculations
*Do I need to do this?*

## tip
*DO NOT call a table a figure, call it a table.*

In the proposal make it sound like it will not be generalisable --- otherwise R&D may want you to go down the route of HRA ethics.

Think about where I will store my data --- ideally on a Trust shared drive.

Question: How will I find in the notes whether escalation has been considered??

# Lecture 1/11/17

*Tip: good stats book: Andy Field: SPSS*

A lot of statistical tests assume a normal distriution of your data.
Some data is squewed, eg, length of hospital stay: This will have a long tail.

*The slides show a lot of stuff about types of data*

Cause and effect: If I change X, how will Y change?
X is the *independent variable*, Y is the *dependent variable*.

Also need to think about control variables (other things that affect it, but are 
controlled), and confounding variables (those that also influence the dependent
variable but are ignored)

All the work in a quantitative study is the planning of the study design.
If it has been well designed then you just put all the numbers in and run the stats
etc that you designed. Compare this with qualitative where all the analysis has to be 
done after collecting the data.

### Questions asked by statistical analysis.
+ Is the distriution different from before and after intervention?
+ Is the difference reliable? hoe confident are you of that?
