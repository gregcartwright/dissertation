# Lecture notes

ethics proposal appendices should contain stuff like particip[ant infoermation sheet, consent form.

## The literature review

It should show how the cummulative knowledge in the field funnels down to focus on your subject.
It should justify why you researched what you did. It should be thorough.
It is useful to recognise yourself as an insider to the field, and how this can sway your judgemnent.

It should lead into your ontology. End the literature reiew chapter with a summary.
Inculsion and exclusion criteria can be listed in an appendix to save words.
Need to justify inclusion and exclusion criteria.

+ Read Louises paper on how to write literature review.

## The ethics proposal

Watch the presentation that is linked on the VLE - how to write an ethics proposal.

The application framework is included in the module guide as an appendix. There is a MSword version on 
VLE too.

It is acceptable, or even expected, for your result to not expect to be generalisable. It would be
useful to comeplete the online HRA tool and include a copy of the result in an appendix to the proposal.
Can include evidence from R&D dept in appendix too.

Louise advises to avoid CAG - ?? do I need it?

Make the desription of the setting as genera las possible to avoid identifying the Trust. Try googling
your description and see if the Trust can be identified.

Chair of the HSC School ethics committe is Karen Sanders.

The proposal must be one document containing *everything*.

Need to think what to do if I inadvertently discover poor pratice.

You may need permission from the Chief Nurse - include as an appendix.

Question: Does accessing patient notes for this study require patient's to consent?

# Lecture 18 Oct 2017

Use the appropriate language for quantitative research.
EG "how I will use my results..."
Need to check the validity of your tools - eg CFS in my context.

## Power calculations
*Do I need to do this?*

## tip
*DO NOT call a table a figure, call it a table.*

In the proposal make it sound like it will not be generalisable --- otherwise R&D may want you to go down the route of HRA ethics.

Think about where I will store my data --- ideally on a Trust shared drive.

Question: How will I find in the notes whether escalation has been considered??

# Lecture 1/11/17

*Tip: good stats book: Andy Field: SPSS*

A lot of statistical tests assume a normal distriution of your data.
Some data is squewed, eg, length of hospital stay: This will have a long tail.

*The slides show a lot of stuff about types of data*

Cause and effect: If I change X, how will Y change?
X is the *independent variable*, Y is the *dependent variable*.

Also need to think about control variables (other things that affect it, but are 
controlled), and confounding variables (those that also influence the dependent
variable but are ignored)

All the work in a quantitative study is the planning of the study design.
If it has been well designed then you just put all the numbers in and run the stats
etc that you designed. Compare this with qualitative where all the analysis has to be 
done after collecting the data.

### Questions asked by statistical analysis.
+ Is the distriution different from before and after intervention?
+ Is the difference reliable? hoe confident are you of that?

### p values
p < 0.05 means we are 95% sure that the difference is not due to chance.

### Why null hypothesis?
You set a null hypothessis. If you reject the null hypothesis then the opposite
*may* be true.

Chi-squared test is a non-parametric test for statistical significance.

## Discussion with Caroline 15 November
Trust R&D person is Susan Corr

Need to discount discussing with OOH due to large workforce - rationalise this.

Think of frailty as a syndrome or disease process that should have a management plan

## Reply to ethics panel

+ Clarify objective 2

Existing objective 2:
"Examine the relationship between frailty and other patient factors and
whether advance care planning is undertaken."

This should be rewritten:
"Examine the relationship between frailty and aother patient factors (age, gender
and presenting complaint) and whether advance care planning is undertaken during
the community hospital in-patient stay."

This means to examine the relationship between frailty and whether advance care
planning happens during the community hospital stay. There may be other factors 
that influence whether advance care
planning happens which may include the age of the patient, their gender and what 
their intial presenting complaint was. I will therefore collect all this data for
each patient so that I can analyse what might influence advance care planning. As
I am investigating what happens to patients during their stay in a community
hospital, I will exclude patients who have a pre-existing ACP when they are 
admitted to the community hospital.

+ Clarify data analyisys plan

For objective 1: *** Sort this out ***

I will categorise frailty by grouping CFS as follows:
+ mild frailty CFS 1 to 5
+ moderate frailty: CFS 6
+ Severe frailty: CFS 7 to 9

The data will initially be presented graphically. These graphs will aim to illustrate
any relationship between advance care planning any factors that might have an 
influence on it: 
frailty, age, gender and initial presenting complaint.

The distribution of the study population will be presented graphically. 

I think that to illustrate the distribution of participants by individual CFS score, a histogram
will be useful. 

To illustrate the distribution by category of frailty, by gender and by presenting 
complaint, pie charts will be used.

A histogram will be useful to show the distribution of participants
by age group. Ages will be grouped as follows:
+ less than 50
+ 50 to 65
+ 65 to 70
+ 75 to 80
+ 85 to 90
+ 90 to 95
+ 95 to 100
+ over 100

I think 
that a pie chart would be good to illustrate this for level of frailty.

A bar chart will be used to show the relative frequencies of advance care planning
for each level of CFS: 1 to 9. A further bar chart will show these frequencies with
CFS grouped into mild frailty (CFS of 1 to 5), moderate frailty (CFS of 6) and severe
frailty (CFS of 7 to 9). The y-axis in these charts will be the number of patients
for each category for whom advance care planning was carried out as a proportion of
the total number of patients in that category.  

Similar bar charts will be used to show the relative frequnecy of advance care
planning for gender, age group and presenting complaint.

For statistical analysis chi squared test will be applied to look for a relationship
between advance care planning and the variables level of frailty, age, gender and 
presenting complaint.

In answer to point 4, I provide a form that will be used to collect data in 
appendix B. In this form the second, third and fourth columns will be "YES/NO"
options. If the entry in the second column is "YES" then the remainder of the 
data will not be collected for that patient as they will not be included in the 
rest of the study.

Chat with Sharon
================
ensure that data analysis links to each objective.

Change non parametric methods will be used to look for correlations to realationships.

Reframe number 2 to ensure that it fully explains the patients that I am interested in.

Then go on to ensure that my data analysis, as explained, supports these objectives.

Probably need to say that I will discount all patients that have an ACP when 
admitted to the ward.
