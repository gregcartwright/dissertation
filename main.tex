\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}

The population of the UK is getting older and this trend is forecast to continue.
In 2016 18\% of the population was over 65 years old, with 2.4\% over 85 years old.
Both these figures are expected to grow over the next 20 years \parencite{ons:17}.

People are living longer but with more comorbities. 

They are becoming more frail.

This makes them more vulnerable to small changes.

Acute hospital admission carries risks.

These are greater for people with frailty.

Frail older people who have no terminal diagnosis account for about 40\% of 
deaths \parencite{sharp:13}.

Benefits if acute admission are reduced for people with frailty.

Risk benefit analysis - favor of not admitting and managing in current location.

Community hospital can actually many treatments.

Decision making during OOH is difficult.

Therefore patients often get admitted.

This should be planned in advance to ensure that patients get most appropriate and beneficial treatment.
