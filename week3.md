# Questions to be answered


## My dissertation is exploring:
The benefits of assessing community hospital inpatients against the Clincal Frailty Scale.

## This is important because:
Many of the patients are likely to be frail. There are guidelines as to what care and management 
should be offered to people with frailty. We currently do not formally assess patients for frailty 
and therefore some of these people will not be getting the best care. The British Geriatrics 
Society (BGS) advise that relatively minor stressors can have major implications for people with 
fraitly. It is therefore ncessary to reduce exposure to stressors. One such stressor is an asdmission to anc acute hospital for a deterioration in health. Often this can be managed in the community hospital
environment.

Also, frailty is a continuum, not a binary quantity. Therefore using a scale to assess it seems 
appropriate.

If a patient has one of the frailty syndromes:
1. Falls
2. Immobility
3. Incontinence
4. Delirium
5. Susceptability to side effects of medication.
This should trigger an assessent of frailty. (fff, BGS).

## I plan to:
Restrospectively assess a set of patients against the clinical frailty Scale and then review the 
notes to assess whether we as a team considered appropriate factors, such as:
+ Advance care planning.

## I aim to collect data from:
As above, I aim to collect my data from patient casenotes. 

## The challenges I can envisage are:
It may be time consuming obtaining casenotes that have gone into storage. This may cause a delay 
in my data collection.

## I intend to overcome them by:
I could limit my patient selection to patients who have been admittesd under the electronic patient
record. This may not give me enough patients and I may have to include other patients too. 
Another problem with this strategy is that it would only include patients from 3 wards, and thus 
only three MDTs. This sample would not be representative of our full patient and MDT population. 

However, I could collect data from the EPR patients first whilst I await the notes from storage.
