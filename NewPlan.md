# New Plan

## Background

The author is an Advanced Nurse Practitioner (ANP) in a community Trust.
The Trust has community hospitals which have wards for inpatient rehabilitation and
medical stepdown. Their are 12 wards accross 8 community hospitals.

Patients get admitted to the acute hospital during out of hours period due to a 
deterioration in their condition.
These events are reviewed retrospectively. Sometimes the ANP feels that transfer 
to an acute hospital was probably not in the patient's best interest and that it
would have been better for them if this deterioration had been managed locally.
This makes me feel that, prior to the event, I should have discussed with them and
their family about developing a treament escalation plan (TEP).
