# New Plan

## Possible structure for proposal

1. Frailty, context and background
     + Community hospital population
     + To include literature review 
     + Discuss prevalence of frailty
     + Discuss frailty as a syndrome or disease process that should have a 
       management plan
     + Examine what that managment plan should be. This should come from the 
       literature review. *This needs to lead on to escalation planning.*
2. Discuss the community hospital age range and common outcomes
     + Increased PoC
     + Placement
     + (Are there numbers to support this?)
3. How to asses frailty
     + Rockwood and rationale for choice of tool
4. Look at level of frailty in community hospital inpatients
     + Get ANPs to do a snapshot of the frailty of all the inpatients
     + Just include SystmOne wards
5. On admission, how many patients have a DNAR order or a TEP?
6. On discharge, how many patients have a DNAR order or a TEP?
7. This should tell us if knowing that our patients are frail informs our 
   management of this.

## Background

The author is an Advanced Nurse Practitioner (ANP) in a community Trust.
The Trust has community hospitals which have wards for inpatient rehabilitation and
medical stepdown. Their are 12 wards accross 8 community hospitals.

Patients get admitted to the acute hospital during out of hours period due to a 
deterioration in their condition.
These events are reviewed retrospectively. Sometimes the ANP feels that transfer 
to an acute hospital was probably not in the patient's best interest and that it
would have been better for them if this deterioration had been managed locally.
This makes me feel that, prior to the event, I should have discussed with them and
their family about developing a treament escalation plan (TEP).
A TEP would not affect the care or treament they receive in community hospital,
it is more about thinking what an acute admission would be able to offer them,
and weighing that up with the risks involved for the individual. It is also about 
finding out what is important to the patient at this stage of their life.

It is advised by the British Geriatrics Society

## What is the problem?

1. Review the literature to show frailty is a problem
    1. What is frailty? Look at various definitions. Look at Frieds phenotypes, plus
        any others. Then lead to Rockwood and the ease of it's use whilst
        remaining valid. Note: Rockwood really assess person's ability to perform
        ADLs and IADLs?
    1. Look at prevalence of frailty
    2. look at problems caused by frailty - morbidity and mortality.


### Cossec et al (2016)  
French study - at least 11% of all aged over 55 were frail, rising
to at least 40% of those aged over 85. Of all people with multimorbidity, at least
75% were pre-frail or frail - does this tell me anything? With relation to Rockwood,
they found IADL dependencey was an independent determinant of frailty, reinforces
CFS being vaild. This paper talks about pre-frailty.

### Collard et al 2012.  
A systematic review including studies from europe, 
North America and Taiwan. Frailty - physiologoical reserve has fallen to a level where 
small disturbance can lead to "a series of complications". Defines pre-frailty.
Found that at least 10% of people aged 65 or over are frail. And prevalence 
of at least 26% for those aged over 85.

### Sternberg et al 2011. 
An operational definition of frailty is important for clinical care.
They suggest that a definition that involves adding up deficits is useful for strategic
planning, less useful for practical clinical use. They found that the most common outcome
of frailty was death. Also found that frailty is a dynamic condition, rather than a static one.
They postulate that different frailty tools are suitable for different purposes. 

### Martin et al 2008. 
Re definition; they state that, although there is debate about the definition,
the concept of an increased vulnerability to stressors is shared. Point out that
some validated tools require numerous complicated measurements to be taken which 
would not routinely be performed in clinical practice, even through a CGA. 
(my words) This would make such a tool impractical to use in such a setiing. They 
talk about an operational tool that even involves measurement of grip strength 
and gait speed. They suggest that the use of simple methods to identify those
at risk of increased dependence may facilitate better use of community-based
management (my words) -> ?benefits to health economy as well as to individual patients.
They conclude by suggesting that there are settings in which a "complex and time consuming"
frailty assessment might not be practical, and there is a need for a score that is
uses "easy-to-collect" data.

### Enrud et al 2008 
Describes CHS index with 5 components, identified as not being practical to use as 
some of its components require knowledge of the disribution of these components within
the population. Other reasons given are that to asses some of the criteria require
time that is unrealistic in the clinical setting. These are not problems for CFS. Results showed 
frailty increased mortality risk by at least 2.4 times.

### Fassbender et al 2009 
Frailty was a leading cause of death in Alberta, attributable for over 30%
of all deaths.

### Office for national statistics 
Looked at all adult sdeaths in England for a 4 month period in 2012. Excluded all deaths
due to accident, homicide and suicide. 42% of remaining deaths were not due to
cancer or cardiovascular disease (CVD). What proportion of this was frailty?

59% of the deaths were in people aged 80 or over. (Think about frailty prevalence in 
this age group) In this age group, 70% of the deaths were non-cancer and non-CVD.

### Romero-ortuno et al 2016
There should not be one tool for measuring frailty, as different tools suit 
different purposes.

Note: this service evaluation project did not need any ethics approval once registered
with the audit department.

Looked at all emergency admissions for a year of patients aged >= 75, mean age of these
was 84.

Frailty is a predictor of inpatient mortality that is independent of confounding variables.
CFS of 7 or 8 and EWS >=4 gives high risk of inpatient mortality. They suggest that CFS
of theis level should be used to trigger early planning of care escalation, and that frailty
generally can be used to focus on personalised care planning and excalation plannning.

### Kingsfund 2014
Frailty is common amongst those who are housebound live in a care home or who have 
home care needs. This is in line with the CFS definitions of frailty.
Even a minor stressor can be catasrophic: immobility, fall, delirium,
non-specific failure to thrive. CGA can reduce incedence of falls, hospital
admission and moves into long term care for people with frailty.
They note that polypharmacy can contribute to delirium for people with frailty, 
and thus polypharmacy should be reviewed and drug regimes consolidated.

Hospital is the least preferred place of death. People with frailty often have poor
end-of-life care and they are less likely to be involved in decision making about
about their care or to have an advanced care plan.

Diffiulty with advance care planning in frailty: there is no event that signals
entering last stages of life compared with, for example, a late diagnosis of 
metastatic cancer. This can mean that this is not identified and subsequently
discussions about advance care planning often do not happen. When someone is
approaching the end of life they must be informed and their multi-faceted needs
assessed. This is also important as soon as possible after idenfication in case 
the person loses capacity to make decisions about their care. Their previous
wishes can then be used to guide future decision making in these circumstances.

They highlight the good example of "Deciding Right", an initiative et up to 
support preofessionals and people make decisions in advance of deterioration
in their health and mental capacity. It helps plans to be documented about future
treament to enable decisions to be made on their behalf.

### Silver book
During the OOH period, many older people are admitted to hospital only to die shortly 
after admission - within hours. OOH clinicians do not know the history of the patient
and are aware that delays in getting the right treament can be catastrophic.
(my words) they probably admit the patient to avoid this risk.

Acknowledges that people being admitted to community hospitals are typically 
older people with frailty.

End of life care in frail older people is often overlooked. (EOL phase might not
be recognised - Kingsfund 2014) Acknowledge that over investigation and uncessary
interventions in this group are costly for the individual and the health economy.

They adivse that preferences for future care should be sought early in the patient
stay.

### Wallis et al 
Inptient mortality and 30-day readmission rates are high for CFS >= 6.

### Kang et at
Looking at patients with ACS. Frailty is an independent risk factor for inpatient
mortality, increased 3-month mortality and increased readmission, but not with 
major adverse cardiovascular events. They argue that CFS shouls be used to plan
patient pathways.

### Juma et al
Frailty is a risk factor for extended length of stay.

### Khalon et al
Frailty is an independent risk factor for readmission or death 30 within 30 days
following discharge.
