# New Plan

## Background

The author is an Advanced Nurse Practitioner (ANP) in a community Trust.
The Trust has community hospitals which have wards for inpatient rehabilitation and
medical stepdown. Their are 12 wards accross 8 community hospitals.

Patients get admitted to the acute hospital during out of hours period due to a 
deterioration in their condition.
These events are reviewed retrospectively. Sometimes the ANP feels that transfer 
to an acute hospital was probably not in the patient's best interest and that it
would have been better for them if this deterioration had been managed locally.
This makes me feel that, prior to the event, I should have discussed with them and
their family about developing a treament escalation plan (TEP).

## What is the problem?

1. Review the literature to show frailty is a problem
    1. What is frailty? Look at various definitions. Look at Frieds phenotypes, plus
        any others. Then lead to Rockwood and the ease of it's use whilst
        remaining valid. Note: Rockwood really assess person's ability to perform
        ADLs and IADLs?
    1. Look at prevalence of frailty
    2. look at problems caused by frailty - morbidity and mortality.

Cossec et al (2016) - french study - at least 11% of all aged over 55 were frail, rising
to at least 40% of those aged over 85. Of all people with multimorbidity, at least
75% were pre-frail or frail - does this tell me anything? With relation to Rockwood,
they found IADL dependencey was an independent determinant of frailty, reinforces
CFS being vaild. This paper talks about pre-frailty.

Collard et al 2012.  A systematic review including studies from europe, 
North America and Taiwan. Frailty - physiologoical reserve has fallen to a level where 
small disturbance can lead to "a series of complications". Defines pre-frailty.
Found that at least 10% of people aged 65 or over are frail. And prevalence 
of at least 26% for those aged over 85.

Sternberg et al 2011. An operational definition of frailty is important for clinical care.
They suggest that a definition that involves adding up deficits is useful for strategic
planning, less useful for practical clinical use. They found that the most common outcome
of frailty was death. Also found that frailty is a dynamic condition, rather than a static one.
They postulate that different frailty tools are suitable for different purposes. 

Martin et al 2008. Re definition; they state that, although there is debate about the definition,
the concept of an increased vulnerability to stressors is shared.
Enrud et al 2008 - read re outcomes.

Fassbender et al 2009 - read re cost of frailty.
