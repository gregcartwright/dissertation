\section*{Introduction}

\subsection*{Background}
The author is an advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) in a community Trust.
The Trust has community hospitals which have wards for inpatient rehabilitation and
medical stepdown. Their are 12 wards accross 8 community hospitals. Each ward has
an ANP who works on the ward to provide medical management of the patients during 
the hours of Monday to Friday, 0900 to 1730. Outside of these hours, medical care 
is provided by the out of hours GP service.

Sometimes patients get admitted to the acute hospital during the out of hours period due to a 
deterioration in their condition.
These events are reviewed retrospectively. Sometimes the ANP feels that, 
due to their subjective level of frailty, transfer 
to an acute hospital was probably not in the patient's best interest and that it
would have been better for them if this deterioration had been managed locally.
This makes me feel that, prior to the event, I should have discussed with the patient and
their family about developing a treament escalation plan (TEP).

Frailty is a condition where the maintenance of homeostasis becomes vulnerable to 
small stressors and is acknowledged to be a large problem amongst the ageing population 
\parencite{clegg:13}.
Whilst the \textcite{bgs:14} advise that frailty is assessed whenever an older person
comes into contact with a healthcare professional, it is not routinely assessed 
in these community hospital inpatients. This raises the question that if all these 
patients were assessed for frailty, and their level of frailty was known to the ANP,
would this make the ANP aware of how vulnerable their homeostais was.
This could then trigger the ANP to consider the pre-emtive planning of escalation
of treament and discussing a TEP with the patient and their family. Indeed,
it is recommended that all patients with frailty have such a plan considered
\parencite{bgs:14}.

\subsection*{What is the size of the problem?}
The clinical frailty scale (CFS) uses clinical judgment to assess level of frailty
\parencite{dalhousie:15}. It has been validated as a tool for predicting adverse
outcomes due to frailty \parencite{rockwood:05} and it may be useful in predicting
inpatient mortality \parencite{wallis:15}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Look at the data to find how many patients accross all the community wards in the
    Trust are readmitted. This data is collected monthly so will be easy to access.
\item Assess the frailty of 10 patients from each ward. Use CFS for this.
	The author could do this for wards which are on electronic patient record, other ANPs
	in the team could assist with other wards.
\end{itemize}

The CFS grades frailty on a scale from 1, very fit, to 9, terminally ill.
It is suspected that most patients will have a CFS score of 7 of more. The above process 
will confirm or refute this. If we assume that this is the case, then it seems
that many of these patients should have a TEP. This leads to the question: 
How many patients have a TEP that can easily be idetified?

\begin{itemize}

\item Assess how many patients on each ward have a TEP. This should be identifiable on 
	the electronic handover, so it could be done remotely.
\end{itemize}

The author suspects that this number will be much smaller than the number of patients 
who have a high frailty score. This then leads to the question: 
What barriers exist to prevent patients having a TEP?

\subsection*{What is the cause of the problem?}
To answer this It would be necessary to disucss with the ANPs and other members of
the MDT, for example nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists.

The next stage would be to identify the main barrier and design an intervention to
address this. If, for example, a barrier is that we don't consider frailty level and
therefore do not think about a TEP, then the intervention could be to add a CFS score
to the electronic handover that is used at the daily board round to stimulate MDT
discussion of possible need of a TEP. This would probably have a financial cost, so
may not be achievable. Adding a CFS score to the electronic patient record (EPR) would 
probably be easier to achieve, but may not stimulate the same level of MDT discussion.
Another potential issue would be that, as the EPR is currently in a process of staged 
rollout, there are only about half the wards on EPR, the remainder remain using paper notes.

The intervention could be introduced, and then the audit for number of patients with 
a TEP could be repeated to see if the intervention has improved the situation. If there 
is no improvment then the problems and barriers could be re-examined to look for another
intervention that might help.
