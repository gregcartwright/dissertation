\title{Dissertation proposal.}
\maketitle
The \textcite[][page 8]{bgs:14} recommend using CFS only after a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA).
The \textcite{bgs:14} set out recommendations for people with frailty. This includes creating a treatment plan and an urgent care plan, based on what is important for the patient.
CFS should be performed after CGA. Therefore we should use it after the MDT has assessed the patient.

Notes from \textcite{rockwood:05}. CFS can be used to guide care of older people. Need to look at interrater reliability.
